        <p>
          As a pole dancer, I've always wanted an app to track my progress and
          moves.
        </p>

        <p>
          Inspired by the PoleMovebook website, I built this app with offline
          support and privacy in mind. It doesn't collect any personal or usage
          data, and all your progress and move lists are stored locally on your
          phone. That said, this app provides an option to back up and restore
          your data to the cloud, if you need to.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've extensively referenced the codes of points from POSA (Pole Sport
          & Arts World Federation) and IPSF (International Pole and Aerial
          Sports Federation) to appropriately determine the category and
          difficulty of moves. This app is designed to empower your pole dancing
          journey, whether you're a beginner or an experienced dancer.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're a software engineer, artist, or a pole instructor, and would
          like to collaborate, please reach out!
