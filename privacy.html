        <p>Last updated: 15 November 2024</p>
        <br />

        <p>
          This Privacy Policy describes how Pole Moves ("we", "us", or "our")
          handles personal information collected through our mobile application
          Pole Moves (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to the collection
          and use of your information in accordance with this policy.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Pole Moves is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. This
          Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your
          information when you use our mobile application.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <ul style="padding-left: 2em">
          <li>
            Error Logs and Crash Reports: We collect error logs and crash
            reports to help us identify and fix issues with the app. This
            information does not include any personal data.
          </li>
          <li>
            iCloud Backup: If you choose to use iCloud for backup, Pole Moves
            does not collect any user data. Your backup data is securely stored
            in your personal iCloud account.
          </li>
          <li>
            Google Drive Backup: If you opt to use Google Drive for backup, Pole
            Moves will request API permission to read and write data to your
            Google Drive AppData directory only. Your backup data is solely
            stored in your Google Drive account, and Pole Moves does not collect
            or store this data.
          </li>
          <li>
            Aggregated Usage Data: We use Firebase, a third-party service, which
            may collect aggregated user usage data. This data is not linked to
            individual users and is used for analyzing overall app performance
            and usage patterns.
          </li>
          <li>
            Anonymous Feedback: Users may submit anonymous feedback or move

            this process.

        </ul>
        <br />

        <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
          We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information
          to third parties unless we provide you with advance notice or are
          required to do so by law. We may disclose your information to trusted
          third parties who assist us in operating the App, as long as those
          parties agree to keep this information confidential..
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          We strive to protect your personal information and implement
          appropriate security measures to safeguard it from unauthorized
          access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of
          transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure,
          and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          Pole Moves may contain links to other sites or services. We are not
          responsible for the privacy practices or content of such third
          parties. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those
          services before providing any personal information.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>

          of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the App. You are
          advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
